# copr-scala

This is a client-side library which provides interaction with the
[Fedora Copr](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/) system.

It was originally written for
[Fedora Mobile](https://github.com/fedora-infra/mobile), but isn't tied to any
specific usecase.

It makes heavy use of the Argonaut library and scalaz.
